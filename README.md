# Contribution
If you want to help with the development of this software feel free! if I get enough requests ill post a code style guide,
i am just an hobbyist and i dont have all the time in the world to develop this, also a majority of this code was written in 2016 
and as i was a highschool student at the time, most of this code needs to be optimized.

# Distribution
